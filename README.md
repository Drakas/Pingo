Pingo

Pingo is a php/ajax script that monitors internet connectivity. Hopefully it will allow for
determining at-a-glance rather the internet is up or down, and which connection is being utilized.

Installation
------------

You need a recent version of PHP with working remote file_get_content function.

1. Clone into a directory
2. Setup vhost and host file to point to directory
3. restart apache and view in web browser.

You can also setup labels for IP addresses, take a look at the pingo class object in the
index.php file for an example.
